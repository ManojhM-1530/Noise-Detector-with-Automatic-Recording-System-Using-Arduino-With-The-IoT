# Noise-Detector-with-Automatic-Recording-System-Using-Arduino-With-The-IoT

Noise pollution is a growing problem in modern cities, thanks to rapid population growth, urbanisation and new technologies. Moreover, at times, a noisy neighbour or co-worker can drive you crazy and affect your well-being.

Talking loudly is an annoying habit in an office environment. Having a loud co-worker can distract us from our work and harm our productivity. To help solve this problem, we bring to you today a noise detector with automatic recording system. This device notifies users whenever it detects loud noise (when the sound crosses certain limits), as well as it automatically records the sound and saves this recorded sound in a file.

This Noise Detector System can be used in library, office and classroom environments to identify noisy people so that necessary action can be taken against them.
